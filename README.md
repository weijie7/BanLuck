# BanLuck
Chinese Blackjack are played mostly in SEA, and is slightly different from the conventional Blackjack. This project will cover:
- Casino-like betting system
- Dealer bot that plays with you with pre-fixed policy
- More visuals and interactive compared to OpenAI Blackjack gym
- With natural win rules like Ban-luck (Ace & 10), Ban Ban (Ace & Ace), Triple-7, and dragon (5 cards with <=21pts in total) with its multiplyer reward
- Game state data will be collected during the game, so at the end of the game, player can review the game summary and see trends
  
I will create another project, using this as game environment, to create a reinforcement learning to boost the winning odds.
